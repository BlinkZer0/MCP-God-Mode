# MCP God Mode - Prompt Templates & Natural Language Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide provides comprehensive prompt templates and examples for using the MCP God Mode tools with natural language. All tools support natural language input and will automatically translate your requests into the appropriate function calls.

## üöÄ How to Use Natural Language

### Basic Pattern
Instead of remembering technical parameters, simply describe what you want to accomplish:

**‚ùå Technical Way:**
```

```

**‚úÖ Natural Language Way:**
```
"Scan for Wi-Fi networks on channel 6"
"Find wireless networks around me"
"Show me all available Wi-Fi networks"
```

## üö® Security & Legal Considerations

### Authorized Use Only
- **All tools are for authorized security testing only**
- Use only on networks/devices you own or have permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Legal Compliance
- Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- Obtain proper authorization before testing
- Respect privacy and data protection requirements

### Ethical Guidelines
- Use tools for defensive security purposes
- Help improve security, not compromise it
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. **Be Specific**
- Instead of "hack something", say "hack the Wi-Fi network called 'OfficeWiFi'"
- Instead of "test security", say "test the security of my Bluetooth speaker"

### 2. **Use Natural Language**
- Describe what you want to accomplish, not how to do it
- Use everyday language, not technical jargon
- Be clear about your target and goals

### 3. **Provide Context**
- Mention the target device/network name
- Specify timeframes when relevant
- Indicate your security testing goals

### 4. **Follow Up**
- Ask for clarification if needed
- Request additional information about results
- Ask for recommendations on next steps

## üìö Example Conversations

### Wi-Fi Security Testing
```
User: "I want to test the security of my home Wi-Fi network"
System: "I'll help you test your home Wi-Fi security. Let me scan for networks first to identify yours."

User: "The network is called 'HomeNetwork'"
System: "Perfect! I'll scan for 'HomeNetwork' and then test its security. Let me start by scanning the area."

User: "What security vulnerabilities did you find?"
System: "I found several potential issues. Let me capture a handshake to test password strength and check for WPS vulnerabilities."
```

### Bluetooth Device Analysis
```
User: "I found a Bluetooth speaker, can you analyze its security?"
System: "I'll help you analyze the Bluetooth speaker's security. Let me scan for nearby devices first."

User: "It's called 'JBL Speaker'"
System: "Found it! Now I'll discover what services it offers and test its security features."

User: "What services does it have?"
System: "The JBL Speaker offers audio streaming, device control, and battery monitoring services. Let me test if any of these are vulnerable to attacks."
```

### Radio Signal Analysis
```
User: "I have an SDR device, can you help me analyze signals?"
System: "Absolutely! I'll help you analyze radio signals with your SDR. Let me first detect your SDR hardware."

User: "What frequencies should I scan?"
System: "I recommend starting with common frequencies: 100 MHz for FM radio, 2.4 GHz for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, and 1090 MHz for aircraft ADS-B signals. Which interests you most?"

User: "Let's check for aircraft signals"
System: "Great choice! I'll tune to 1090 MHz and decode ADS-B signals to show you aircraft positions and information."
```

## üéâ Summary

The MCP God Mode tools are designed to be **intuitive and natural language friendly**. You don't need to remember technical parameters or command syntax - just describe what you want to accomplish in plain English, and the system will:

1. **Understand your intent** from natural language
2. **Translate your request** into the appropriate tool calls
3. **Execute the operations** with optimal parameters
4. **Provide results** in an easy-to-understand format

This makes powerful security testing accessible to everyone while maintaining the sophisticated functionality that security professionals need.
