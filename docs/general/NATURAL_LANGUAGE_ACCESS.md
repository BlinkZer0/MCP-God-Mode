# Natural Language Access to Security Tools

## üéØ Overview

All security tools in the MCP God Mode project can now be accessed using natural language! This means you can simply describe what you want to do in plain English, and the system will automatically route your request to the appropriate toolkit.

## üöÄ How It Works

Instead of remembering specific tool names or technical parameters, you can now ask for what you want to accomplish:
