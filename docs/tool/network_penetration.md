## Input Schema
- **target** (required): The network target to test. Examples: '192.168.1.0/24', '10.0.0.1', 'company.com', or specific IP address.
- **action** (required): The penetration testing action to perform. Examples: 'scan for vulnerabilities', 'test network security', 'find open ports', 'assess network defenses', 'penetration test'.
- **method** (optional): Testing method or approach. Examples: 'port scan', 'vulnerability scan', 'network mapping', 'service enumeration', 'security assessment'.

## Output Schema
Returns network penetration testing results with identified vulnerabilities, open ports, security weaknesses, and remediation recommendations.

## Natural Language Access
Users can request network penetration testing operations using natural language:
- "Test the security of my home network"
- "Find vulnerabilities in the office network"
- "Scan for open ports on the server"
- "Assess network defenses and security"
- "Perform a penetration test on the network"
- "Map the network topology and services"
- "Test network security configurations"

## Usage Examples

### Network Security Testing
```javascript
// Test home network security
const result = await network_penetration({
  target: "192.168.1.0/24",
  action: "test network security",
  method: "vulnerability scan"
});
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
```javascript
// Find network vulnerabilities
const result = await network_penetration({
  target: "10.0.0.0/24",
  action: "find vulnerabilities",
  method: "port scan"
});
```

### Port Scanning
```javascript
// Scan for open ports
const result = await network_penetration({
  target: "192.168.1.1",
  action: "scan for vulnerabilities",
  method: "port scan"
});
```

### Network Mapping
```javascript
// Map network topology
const result = await network_penetration({
  target: "company.com",
  action: "assess network defenses",
  method: "network mapping"
});
```
