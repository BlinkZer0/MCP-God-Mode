## Description
Wireless network security assessment using natural language. Ask me to test Wi-Fi security, assess wireless vulnerabilities, or analyze network safety. Provides comprehensive wireless security testing capabilities across multiple platforms.

## Input Schema
- **target** (required): The wireless network target. Examples: 'OfficeWiFi', 'HomeNetwork', 'GuestAccess', or BSSID like 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF'.
- **action** (required): What you want to do with wireless security. Examples: 'test security', 'find vulnerabilities', 'assess safety', 'check for weaknesses', 'analyze security'.
- **method** (optional): Preferred method or approach. Examples: 'scan networks', 'capture handshake', 'test passwords', 'check WPS vulnerabilities'.

## Output Schema
Returns wireless security assessment results with identified vulnerabilities, security recommendations, and detailed analysis.

## Natural Language Access
Users can request wireless security operations using natural language:
- "Test the security of my office Wi-Fi network"
- "Find vulnerabilities in the home wireless network"
- "Assess the safety of the guest Wi-Fi access"
- "Check for weaknesses in the wireless router"
- "Analyze the security of nearby networks"
- "Test password strength on the network"
- "Check for WPS vulnerabilities"

## Usage Examples

### Wi-Fi Security Testing
```javascript
// Test office Wi-Fi security
const result = await wireless_security({
  target: "OfficeWiFi",
  action: "test security",
  method: "scan networks"
});
```

### Vulnerability Assessment
```javascript
// Find vulnerabilities in home network
const result = await wireless_security({
  target: "HomeNetwork",
  action: "find vulnerabilities",
  method: "check WPS vulnerabilities"
});
```

### Network Safety Analysis
```javascript
// Assess guest network safety
const result = await wireless_security({
  target: "GuestAccess",
  action: "assess safety",
  method: "test passwords"
});
```

### BSSID-Based Testing
```javascript
// Test specific access point
const result = await wireless_security({
  target: "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
  action: "analyze security",
  method: "capture handshake"
});
```
