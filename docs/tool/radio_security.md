# Radio Security Tool

## Overview
Radio security and signal analysis tool for testing radio frequency communications, analyzing wireless protocols, and assessing radio security vulnerabilities. Supports various radio frequencies, modulation types, and security protocols across multiple platforms.

## Description
Radio security and signal analysis tool for testing radio frequency communications, analyzing wireless protocols, and assessing radio security vulnerabilities. Supports various radio frequencies, modulation types, and security protocols across multiple platforms.

## Input Schema
- **action** (required): Radio security action to perform. 'scan_frequencies' for frequency scanning, 'analyze_signals' for signal analysis, 'test_security' for security testing, 'capture_traffic' for traffic capture, 'jam_frequencies' for frequency jamming, 'decode_protocols' for protocol decoding.
- **frequency** (optional): Target frequency in Hz. Examples: 433000000 for 433 MHz, 2400000000 for 2.4 GHz, 5000000000 for 5 GHz.
- **modulation** (optional): Modulation type to analyze. Examples: 'AM', 'FM', 'FSK', 'PSK', 'QAM', 'OFDM'.
- **duration** (optional): Analysis duration in seconds. Examples: 30 for quick scan, 300 for detailed analysis, 3600 for long-term monitoring.
- **output_file** (optional): File path to save analysis results. Examples: './radio_analysis.json', './captured_signals.pcap'.

## Output Schema
Returns radio analysis results with frequency information, signal characteristics, and security assessment data.

## Natural Language Access
Users can request radio security operations using natural language:
- "Scan for radio frequencies in my area"
- "Analyze the security of wireless signals"
- "Test radio frequency security vulnerabilities"
- "Capture radio traffic for analysis"
- "Decode radio protocols and signals"

## Usage Examples

### Frequency Scanning
```javascript
// Scan for active radio frequencies
const result = await radio_security({
  action: "scan_frequencies",
  frequency: 433000000,
  duration: 120
});
```

### Signal Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze signal characteristics
const result = await radio_security({
  action: "analyze_signals",
  frequency: 2400000000,
  modulation: "FSK",
  duration: 300
});
```

### Security Testing
```javascript
// Test radio security vulnerabilities
const result = await radio_security({
  action: "test_security",
  frequency: 5000000000,
  duration: 600,
  output_file: "./security_report.json"
});
```
