## Description
Advanced Wi-Fi security penetration testing and exploitation toolkit. Perform comprehensive Wi-Fi network assessments, password cracking, evil twin attacks, WPS exploitation, and IoT device enumeration. Supports all Wi-Fi security protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3) across multiple platforms with ethical hacking methodologies.

## Input Schema
- **action** (required): Wi-Fi security testing action. 'scan_networks' discovers APs, 'capture_handshake' grabs WPA handshakes, 'capture_pmkid' uses PMKID attack, 'crack_hash' breaks passwords, attack options include 'dictionary_attack', 'brute_force_attack', 'evil_twin_attack' for phishing, 'deauth_attack' for disconnection, 'wps_attack' exploits WPS, 'vulnerability_scan' finds weaknesses.
- **target_ssid** (optional): Target Wi-Fi network name (SSID) to attack. Examples: 'OfficeWiFi', 'HOME-NETWORK-5G', 'Guest-Access'. Case-sensitive network identifier for focused attacks.
- **target_bssid** (optional): Target access point MAC address (BSSID). Format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. Examples: '00:11:22:33:44:55', 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF'. More precise targeting than SSID when multiple APs share names.
- **interface** (optional): Wireless network interface for attacks. Examples: 'wlan0' (Linux), 'Wi-Fi' (Windows), 'en0' (macOS). Must support monitor mode for most attacks. Leave empty for auto-detection.
- **wordlist** (optional): Password wordlist file path for dictionary attacks. Examples: './rockyou.txt', '/usr/share/wordlists/common.txt', 'C:\\Security\\passwords.txt'. Should contain one password per line for effective cracking.
- **output_file** (optional): File path to save attack results, captures, or cracked passwords. Examples: './wifi_capture.pcap', '/tmp/handshake.cap', 'C:\\Security\\results.txt'. Helps organize and preserve attack evidence.
- **duration** (optional): Attack duration in seconds. Examples: 30 for quick scans, 300 for handshake capture, 3600 for comprehensive attacks. Longer durations increase success rates but take more time.
- **max_attempts** (optional): Maximum attempts for brute force or WPS attacks. Examples: 1000 for WPS, 10000 for dictionary attacks, 100000+ for brute force. Higher values increase success but require more time.
- **attack_type** (optional): Wi-Fi security protocol to target. 'wpa'/'wpa2' most common, 'wpa3' newest/strongest, 'wep' outdated/vulnerable, 'wps' router feature often exploitable. Choose based on target network type.
- **channel** (optional): Specific Wi-Fi channel to focus attacks (1-13 for 2.4GHz, 36-165 for 5GHz). Examples: 6 for common 2.4GHz, 149 for 5GHz. Targeting specific channels improves attack efficiency and reduces interference.
- **power_level** (optional): RF transmission power level (0-100%). Examples: 20-50% for stealth operations to avoid detection, 80-100% for maximum range and attack effectiveness. Higher power increases success but may be more noticeable.

## Output Schema
Returns attack results with success status, captured data, and detailed analysis information.

## Natural Language Access
Users can request Wi-Fi hacking operations using natural language:

- "Perform a WPS attack on the router"
- "Capture handshakes from nearby networks"
- "Create an evil twin attack for testing"
- "Scan for vulnerable Wi-Fi networks"
- "Test the security of my home network"
- "Perform a deauthentication attack"

  duration: 300,
  output_file: "./captured_handshake.pcap"
});
```

### Password Cracking
```javascript
// Crack captured handshake using dictionary attack
const result = await wifi_hacking({
  action: "dictionary_attack",
  target_ssid: "OfficeWiFi",
  wordlist: "./rockyou.txt",
  max_attempts: 10000,
  output_file: "./cracked_password.txt"
});
```

### WPS Attack
```javascript
// Exploit WPS vulnerability
const result = await wifi_hacking({
  action: "wps_attack",
  target_ssid: "HomeNetwork",
  max_attempts: 1000,
  duration: 600
});
```

### Evil Twin Attack
