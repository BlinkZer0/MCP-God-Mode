## Natural Language Access
Users can ask for this tool using natural language such as:
- "Scan for Wi-Fi networks in the area"
- "Test the security of my home network"
- "Capture handshakes from the office Wi-Fi"
- "Check if my router has WPS vulnerabilities"
- "Perform a security assessment of wireless networks"
- "Find weak passwords on my network"
- "Test for evil twin attacks"
- "Analyze Wi-Fi security weaknesses"

## Examples

### Network Scanning
```typescript
// Scan for available networks
const result = await server.callTool("wifi_security_toolkit", { 
  action: "scan_networks",
  interface: "wlan0"
});

// Scan specific channel
const result = await server.callTool("wifi_security_toolkit", { 
  action: "scan_networks",
  channel: 6,
  power_level: 50
});
```

### Security Testing
```typescript
// Test WPS vulnerabilities
const result = await server.callTool("wifi_security_toolkit", { 
  action: "wps_attack",
  target_ssid: "OfficeWiFi",
  max_attempts: 1000
});

// Capture handshake
const result = await server.callTool("wifi_security_toolkit", { 
  action: "capture_handshake",
  target_ssid: "HomeNetwork",
  duration: 300,
  output_file: "./captured_handshake.pcap"
});
```
