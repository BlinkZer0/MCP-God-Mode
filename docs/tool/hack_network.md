## Description
Comprehensive network penetration testing and security assessment tool with intelligent routing to specialized toolkits. Perform network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, wireless attacks, and system penetration testing. Automatically selects appropriate security tools based on target type and attack methodology.

## Input Schema
- **target** (required): Target network, system, or device to test. Examples: '192.168.1.0/24' for network range, '10.0.0.1' for specific host, 'company.com' for domain, 'OfficeWiFi' for wireless network, '00:11:22:33:44:55' for Bluetooth device. Determines which security toolkit to use.
- **action** (required): Security testing action to perform. Examples: 'hack network', 'break into system', 'test security', 'find vulnerabilities', 'crack password', 'penetration test', 'security assessment'. Natural language descriptions of desired testing goals.
- **method** (optional): Preferred testing methodology or approach. Examples: 'port scan', 'brute force', 'dictionary attack', 'vulnerability scan', 'wireless attack', 'social engineering'. Helps select specific attack techniques within toolkits.
- **duration** (optional): Testing duration in seconds. Examples: 300 for quick assessment, 1800 for detailed scan, 3600 for comprehensive penetration test. Longer durations provide more thorough results but take more time.

## Output Schema
Returns comprehensive security assessment results with identified vulnerabilities, attack paths, and remediation recommendations.

## Natural Language Access
Users can request network hacking operations using natural language:
- "Hack into the company network"
- "Test the security of my home network"
- "Find vulnerabilities in the office Wi-Fi"
- "Perform a penetration test on the server"
- "Crack passwords on the network"
- "Scan for open ports and services"
- "Test network defenses and security"

const result = await hack_network({
  target: "OfficeWiFi",
  action: "test security",
  method: "wireless attack",
  duration: 1800
});
```

### System Security Assessment
```javascript
// Assess individual system security
const result = await hack_network({
  target: "10.0.0.1",
  action: "find vulnerabilities",
  method: "port scan",
  duration: 900
});
```

### Domain Security Testing
```javascript
// Test domain and web application security
const result = await hack_network({
  target: "company.com",
  action: "security assessment",
  method: "vulnerability scan",
  duration: 2400
});
```
