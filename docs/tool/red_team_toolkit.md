  - `medium` - Moderate stealth
  - `high` - High stealth
  - `maximum` - Maximum stealth

- `persistence_duration` (string, optional): Duration to maintain persistence (e.g., '30d', '90d')
- `include_evasion` (boolean, optional): Include advanced evasion techniques (default: true)
- `output_format` (string, optional): Output format for results (default: json)

## Real-World Attack Capabilities

### Reconnaissance
- Network discovery and host enumeration
- Port scanning with stealth techniques
- Service enumeration and fingerprinting
- Vulnerability scanning

### Initial Access
- Web application exploitation (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Network service exploitation (EternalBlue, BlueKeep, etc.)
- Phishing campaign execution
- Social engineering attacks

### Lateral Movement
- Network resource discovery
- Credential harvesting (Mimikatz, etc.)
- Pass-the-hash attacks
- Remote service exploitation

### Privilege Escalation
- System enumeration
- Kernel vulnerability exploitation
- Token manipulation
- Local privilege escalation

### Persistence
- Scheduled task creation
- Service installation
- Registry modification
- Startup folder manipulation

### Data Exfiltration
- Sensitive data discovery
- Data collection and staging
- Encrypted data exfiltration
- Command and control communication

### Defense Evasion
- Process hollowing
- DLL injection
- Event log clearing
- Anti-forensics techniques

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Execute initial access attack
await server.callTool("red_team_toolkit", {
  action: "initial_access",
  target_environment: "192.168.1.0/24",
  attack_vector: "web_application",
  stealth_level: "high"
});

// Execute full attack chain
await server.callTool("red_team_toolkit", {
  action: "full_attack_chain",
  target_environment: "target-organization.com",
  attack_vector: "phishing",
  stealth_level: "maximum",
  persistence_duration: "90d",
  include_evasion: true
});
```

## Security Considerations

### Detection Risks
- **Low Stealth**: High detection probability, suitable for testing detection capabilities
- **Medium Stealth**: Moderate detection probability, balanced approach
- **High Stealth**: Low detection probability, advanced evasion techniques
- **Maximum Stealth**: Very low detection probability, state-of-the-art evasion

### Mitigation Recommendations
- Implement comprehensive network monitoring
- Deploy advanced threat detection systems
- Conduct regular security awareness training
- Establish incident response procedures
- Implement network segmentation
- Use least privilege access controls
