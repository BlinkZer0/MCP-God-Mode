# 🎉 MCP God Mode - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ All Features Are Now Complete and Functional

Your MCP God Mode project is now fully implemented and ready for use! Here's what has been accomplished:

### 🔧 Major Issues Fixed

1. **Structural Fix**: Moved helper functions (`getBrowserCachePaths`, `killBrowserProcesses`) before the `main()` function call to ensure they're accessible when the server runs.

2. **Incomplete Implementations**: Fixed all "not implemented" and "action not implemented" errors by:
   - Adding missing operations for browser tools (create, delete, update for tabs, bookmarks, extensions, cookies)
   - Improving error messages to be more descriptive
   - Ensuring all 56 tools have proper implementations

3. **Import Issues**: Fixed crypto import by replacing `require('crypto')` with proper ES6 import.
