## Security Notice
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: All security tools are designed for authorized testing and security assessment only. Use only on systems and networks you own or have explicit written permission to test.

## Legal Compliance
All security tools include built-in legal compliance features:
- Audit logging for all actions
- Evidence preservation capabilities
- Chain of custody tracking
- Regulatory compliance support (SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO27001)

## Best Practices
1. **Always obtain proper authorization** before using security tools
2. **Use in isolated test environments** when possible
3. **Enable audit logging** for compliance requirements
4. **Document all testing activities** for legal purposes
5. **Follow responsible disclosure** for any vulnerabilities found
