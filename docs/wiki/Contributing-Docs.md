# Contributing to Docs

Help us document the route cause of greatness.

## Principles

- Precise over prolix: say exactly what the code does.
- Task-first: start with how to accomplish a task, then details.
- Link liberally: keep pages short and connected.
- Keep headers animated: include a header SVG at the top.

## How-To

- Create a new file in `docs/wiki/`.
- Add an animated header via `<img src="../../assets/headers/animated-header-*.svg" />`.
- Cross-link from `docs/wiki/Overview.md` and, if relevant, from `README.md`.

## Puns Policy

Yes. Tastefully. Ship with smiles per hour.
