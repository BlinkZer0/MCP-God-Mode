## 🚨 Security Considerations

> *"I've made a huge mistake"* - Gob Bluth (probably after installing this)

1. **Full System Access**: This server can access and modify any file on the system
2. **Command Execution**: Can run any command with full privileges
3. **Registry Access**: Can read and write to Windows registry
4. **Service Control**: Can start, stop, and modify Windows services
5. **Network Operations**: Can perform network scanning and discovery

## 🛡️ **Safety Features for Troubleshooting**

### **Built-in Protections**
- **Command Sanitization**: Prevents accidental command injection
- **Dangerous Command Detection**: Flags potentially harmful operations
- **Structured Logging**: Tracks all operations for audit trails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with detailed error messages

### **Best Practices for Safe Troubleshooting**
1. **Start Small**: Begin with read-only operations like `system_info` and `fs_list`
2. **Backup First**: Create system restore points before making changes
3. **Test Commands**: Try commands in a safe environment first
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check the structured logs to see what's happening
5. **Use Security Features**: Keep `ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS=true` for extra protection
