## 📖 Usage Instructions – Unleash on AI Platforms

To use the MCP and its tools:
1. Install as below.
2. Connect via your AI platform (e.g., Cursor/Claude).
3. Interact naturally: Ask your AI things like "Run a system repair" or "Create a Docker container" – the AI will use the appropriate tool.
4. For specific tools, you can reference them directly if needed, but natural language is preferred.
5. Check tool schemas in the code for advanced usage.

**🛡️ Security Settings (Environment Variables):**
- `ALLOWED_ROOT`: Comma-separated list of allowed root paths (default: all drives)
- `WEB_ALLOWLIST`: Allowed web domains (default: unrestricted)
- `PROC_ALLOWLIST`: Allowed processes/commands (default: unrestricted)
- `ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS`: Enable dangerous command detection (default: true)

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Guardrails Are OFF By Default!**

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** MCP God Mode ships with guardrails **DISABLED** by default to provide maximum flexibility. This means your AI has **unrestricted access** to your entire system!

**🔒 How to Enable Guardrails (RECOMMENDED):**

Set these environment variables to restrict access and enable security features:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ALLOWED_ROOT="C:\Users\YourUsername,C:\Projects"
$env:WEB_ALLOWLIST="github.com,httpbin.org"
$env:PROC_ALLOWLIST="notepad,chrome,code"
$env:ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"
$env:RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"
$env:BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"

# Linux/macOS
export ALLOWED_ROOT="/home/username,/opt/projects"
export WEB_ALLOWLIST="github.com,httpbin.org"
export PROC_ALLOWLIST="nano,chrome,code"
export ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"
export RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"
export BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"
```

**🛡️ Security Environment Variables Explained:**

- **`ALLOWED_ROOT`**: Restrict file operations to specific directories
  - **Example:** `"C:\Users\YourUsername,C:\Projects"` (Windows) or `"/home/username,/opt/projects"` (Linux/macOS)
  - **Default:** All drives accessible (UNSAFE!)

- **`WEB_ALLOWLIST`**: Restrict web downloads to trusted domains
  - **Example:** `"github.com,httpbin.org,trusted-site.com"`
  - **Default:** All domains allowed (UNSAFE!)

- **`PROC_ALLOWLIST`**: Restrict which processes can be executed
  - **Example:** `"notepad,chrome,code,python"`
  - **Default:** All processes allowed (UNSAFE!)

- **`ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS`**: Enable dangerous command detection
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"true"` (Good!)

- **`RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS`**: Limit file operations to safe actions
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"false"` (UNSAFE!)

- **`BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS`**: Block potentially harmful system commands
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"false"` (UNSAFE!)

**🚨 Why Guardrails Are Off By Default:**

1. **Maximum Flexibility:** Some users need unrestricted access for advanced automation
2. **Testing & Development:** Developers need full system access for debugging
3. **Trusted Environments:** Some users operate in controlled, trusted environments
4. **Legacy Compatibility:** Ensures existing workflows continue to function

**🔐 Production Security Checklist:**

Before using in production, ensure you have:

- ✅ **Restricted root paths** (`ALLOWED_ROOT`)
- ✅ **Limited web access** (`WEB_ALLOWLIST`)
- ✅ **Process restrictions** (`PROC_ALLOWLIST`)
- ✅ **Security checks enabled** (`ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"`)
- ✅ **File operation restrictions** (`RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"`)
- ✅ **Dangerous command blocking** (`BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"`)

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with restrictive settings and gradually loosen them as needed. It's easier to grant access than to recover from a security incident!

**⚠️ Important:** This MCP has extensive system access. Use responsibly and only on systems you own.

**Comedic Tip:** Start with "Hello, world" not "Delete everything."
