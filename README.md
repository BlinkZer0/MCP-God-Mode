  "logType": "system",
  "filter": "error",
  "timeRange": "24h",
  "level": "error",
  "maxEvents": 100
}
```
Advanced event log analysis with pattern detection:
- **`logType`** - System, Application, Security, Setup, ForwardedEvents
- **`filter`** - Text filter for events
- **`timeRange`** - 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d
- **`level`** - Error, Warning, Information, Critical, All
- **`maxEvents`** - Maximum number of events to analyze

## 🔧 Configuration

The server is configured through environment variables:

- `ALLOWED_ROOT` - Comma-separated list of allowed root paths (empty = all paths allowed)
- `WEB_ALLOWLIST` - Comma-separated list of allowed web hosts (empty = all hosts allowed)
- `PROC_ALLOWLIST` - Comma-separated list of allowed commands (empty = all commands allowed)
- `EXTRA_PATH` - Additional PATH entries
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) - default: info
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE` - Maximum file size in bytes for read operations - default: 1000000
- `COMMAND_TIMEOUT` - Command execution timeout in milliseconds - default: 30000
- `ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS` - Enable additional security validations - default: true

For God Mode operation, all variables should be empty or unset.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Command Sanitization
- All command inputs are sanitized to prevent command injection
- Dangerous characters are removed from command arguments
- Potentially dangerous commands are flagged and logged

### Input Validation
- File paths are validated against allowed roots
- Command arguments are sanitized and validated
- Registry operations are restricted to safe operations

### Logging & Monitoring
- Structured logging with timestamps and error tracking
- Security events are logged with detailed context
- Command execution attempts are monitored

### Environment Controls
- Configurable security checks via environment variables
- Timeout protection for long-running commands
- File size limits to prevent memory exhaustion

**⚠️ Security Note:** While these features provide basic protection, this server is designed for "God Mode" operation and should only be used in trusted environments.

## 🚨 Security Considerations

> *"I've made a huge mistake"* - Gob Bluth (probably after installing this)

1. **Full System Access**: This server can access and modify any file on the system
2. **Command Execution**: Can run any command with full privileges
3. **Registry Access**: Can read and write to Windows registry
4. **Service Control**: Can start, stop, and modify Windows services
5. **Network Operations**: Can perform network scanning and discovery

## 🛡️ **Safety Features for Troubleshooting**

### **Built-in Protections**
- **Command Sanitization**: Prevents accidental command injection
- **Dangerous Command Detection**: Flags potentially harmful operations
- **Structured Logging**: Tracks all operations for audit trails
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with detailed error messages

### **Best Practices for Safe Troubleshooting**
1. **Start Small**: Begin with read-only operations like `system_info` and `fs_list`
2. **Backup First**: Create system restore points before making changes
3. **Test Commands**: Try commands in a safe environment first
4. **Monitor Logs**: Check the structured logs to see what's happening
5. **Use Security Features**: Keep `ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS=true` for extra protection

```

## 🚀 **Getting Started with Troubleshooting**

### **Step 1: Basic System Check**
Start with these commands to get familiar:
```bash
"Show me system information"
"List running processes"
"Check available disk space"
"Show Windows services status"
```

### **Step 2: Identify the Problem**
Ask specific questions about your issue:
```bash
"My computer is slow - what's using the most CPU?"
"I can't connect to the internet - test my network"
"An application keeps crashing - find error logs"
"My disk is full - find large files"
```

### **Step 3: Fix the Issue**
Use the appropriate tools to resolve problems:
```bash
"Restart the Windows Update service"
"Stop the problematic process"
"Clean up temporary files"
"Fix the registry entry"
"Create a restore point"
```

### **Step 4: Verify the Fix**
Confirm everything is working:
```bash
"Check if the service is running now"
"Test the network connection again"
"Monitor system performance"
"Verify the changes worked"
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd dev
node test/smoke.mjs
```

This will test all available tools and verify the server is working correctly.
