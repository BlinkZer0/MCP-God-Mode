## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: God Mode Activated ‚Äì Buckle Up!

> *"Absolute power corrupts absolutely... especially when your AI starts renaming your files to 'lol_human_error.txt'."* - Some wise guy

**Use this MCP at your own risk! Blink Zero takes no responsibility for a ruined system as a result of careless use.** That being said, this project is open source, and moreover an experiment. Have fun.

This MCP can do wild stuff:
- Execute commands on any OS like it's no big deal
- Access every file, drive, partition (hello C:, /, and friends!)
- Mess with registries, configs, services across platforms
- Manage disks, networks, resources in real-time
- And tons more ‚Äì basically, AI's playground.

**Use on your own systems only.** Back up everything, or live dangerously.

- **Monitoring Mayhem:** Real-time CPU, memory, disk tracking. (Catch that resource hog red-handed!) *Humor: Stalking your own PC. Intention: Blink Zero training AI for surveillance state?*

- **File System Frenzy:** Browse, edit, delete across all drives. (With great power comes great 'oops' moments.) *Humor: Accidentally delete your wedding photos? Blame the AI! Intention: Testing how many users cry 'undo'?*

- **Process & Service Shenanigans:** List, kill, manage like a pro. (Terminate with extreme prejudice!) *Humor: AI as hitman for rogue processes. Intention: Blink Zero hates background apps personally?*

- **Network & Security Laughs:** Diagnostics, scans, audits. (AI: \"Your password is 'password'? Cute.\") *Humor: AI roasting your security habits. Intention: Shaming users into better passwords?*

- **Extra Goodies:** Hardware info, email sending, git ops, browser control, math tools, and more. (Why? Because we can!) *Humor: Math in a system tool? Next up, recipe suggestions. Intention: Blink Zero building an AI overlord one feature at a time?*

**Funny Note:** Features so comprehensive, your AI might start charging rent for living in your PC.
