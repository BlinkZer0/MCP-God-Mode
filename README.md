## üë®‚Äçüíª Meet the Developer

**Blink Zero** - The chaotic neutral coder blending AGI with infosec madness! üß™ When not architecting potential digital apocalypses, I'm:

- **üîí Infosec Sorcerer:** Hacking ethically to build better defenses.
- **üåç Platform Conqueror:** Making tools that mock OS boundaries.
- **ü§ñ AGI Wrangler:** Taming AI power without the rebellion.
- **üì± Mobile Maverick:** Turning devices into extensions of will.
- **ü•ã Martial Artist:** Practicing moves that look cooler than my code.

**Vision Upgraded:** Creating AGI tools that make infosec accessible and fun ‚Äì because why suffer in silence? Power to the people, but with safeguards against stupid AIs.

(Keep GIFs here.)

**üéØ What I'm Actually Trying to Do:**
Create tools that make complex system administration accessible to everyone through natural language. Think of it as giving your grandma the ability to hack networks using plain English - "Hack the Wi-Fi, dear" instead of memorizing 50 different commands.

**üö® Why This Exists:**
Because sometimes you need an AI that can:
- Fix your system while making you laugh
- Access every platform without discrimination
- Perform security testing without requiring a PhD in cybersecurity
- Make complex operations feel like asking for directions

**ü§ù Connect With Me:**
- **GitHub:** [@blinkzero](https://github.com/blinkzero) - Where the magic happens
- **üéµ SoundCloud:** [@shurikenmiasma](https://soundcloud.com/shurikenmiasma) - Uncannily tuned melodies with irrational time signatures

- **üéß Spotify:** [Shuriken Miasma](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1a9Jqhz5BwncRKMWBhzbpY) - Stream my music on all major platforms
- **Projects:** Building the future, one AI tool at a time
- **Philosophy:** "If it can be automated, it should be automated. If it can't be automated, automate it anyway."

**üí° The Vision:**
Democratizing system administration and security testing through AI. No more gatekeeping, no more "you need to be technical" - just ask your AI what you need, and watch the magic happen.

**üé≠ Disclaimer:**
I take no responsibility for AI assistants that develop a sense of humor and start renaming your files to "lol_human_error.txt". That's on you for giving them access to your system! üòÑ

**ü•ã Martial Arts Moves - Because Why Not?**
When I'm not coding AI overlords, I'm practicing martial arts. Here are some of my signature moves:

![3 Section Stall - Sanjiegun](docs/3section-stall-sanjiegun.gif)
*3 Section Stall - Sanjiegun technique*

![Jumping Switch Front Kick - Shuriken Miasma](docs/jumping-switch-front-kick-shuriken-miasma.gif)
*Jumping Switch Front Kick - Pure power and precision*

![Nunchaku Shuriken Miasma](docs/nunchaku-shuriken-miasma.gif)
*Nunchaku mastery - Because nunchucks are always cool*

![Spinning Back Kick Ground Touch](docs/spinning-back-kick-ground-touch.gif)
*Spinning Back Kick with Ground Touch - Advanced technique*

**üí° Fun Fact:** The name "Shuriken Miasma" comes from my martial arts background - frequencies like a cloud of tiny daggers finding the vital spaces of your ear. Sharp highs and warm lows are the vehicles this assault usually takes!

## üîß Under the Hood ‚Äì The Tech Comedy

Built on Node.js with cross-platform wizardry:

- **Platform Detection:** 
  ```typescript
  const PLATFORM = os.platform();
  // Checks if Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, or iOS ‚Äì then adapts like a chameleon on steroids.
  ```

- **Command Translation:** Maps your requests to OS-specific commands (tasklist for Win, ps for others, pm for Android, etc.).

- **Security (Hopefully):** Input sanitization, logging, error handling. (Prevents AI from going full HAL 9000.)

- **AI Integration:** Hooks into LLMs for smart processing.

- **Dependencies:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, simple-git, etc. ‚Äì the secret sauce.

**Why Revolutionary Here:** Combines AI with system access in a unified, cross-platform way. No one's done this before ‚Äì it's like inventing the wheel, but for AI overlords!

## üìñ Usage Instructions ‚Äì Unleash on AI Platforms

To use the MCP and its tools:
1. Install as below.
2. Connect via your AI platform (e.g., Cursor/Claude).
3. Interact naturally: Ask your AI things like "Run a system repair" or "Create a Docker container" ‚Äì the AI will use the appropriate tool.
4. For specific tools, you can reference them directly if needed, but natural language is preferred.
5. Check tool schemas in the code for advanced usage.

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Settings (Environment Variables):**
- `ALLOWED_ROOT`: Comma-separated list of allowed root paths (default: all drives)
- `WEB_ALLOWLIST`: Allowed web domains (default: unrestricted)
- `PROC_ALLOWLIST`: Allowed processes/commands (default: unrestricted)
- `ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS`: Enable dangerous command detection (default: true)

## üö® **IMPORTANT: Guardrails Are OFF By Default!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** MCP God Mode ships with guardrails **DISABLED** by default to provide maximum flexibility. This means your AI has **unrestricted access** to your entire system!

**üîí How to Enable Guardrails (RECOMMENDED):**

Set these environment variables to restrict access and enable security features:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ALLOWED_ROOT="C:\Users\YourUsername,C:\Projects"
$env:WEB_ALLOWLIST="github.com,httpbin.org"
$env:PROC_ALLOWLIST="notepad,chrome,code"
$env:ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"
$env:RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"
$env:BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"

# Linux/macOS
export ALLOWED_ROOT="/home/username,/opt/projects"
export WEB_ALLOWLIST="github.com,httpbin.org"
export PROC_ALLOWLIST="nano,chrome,code"
export ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"
export RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"
export BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"
```

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Environment Variables Explained:**

- **`ALLOWED_ROOT`**: Restrict file operations to specific directories
  - **Example:** `"C:\Users\YourUsername,C:\Projects"` (Windows) or `"/home/username,/opt/projects"` (Linux/macOS)
  - **Default:** All drives accessible (UNSAFE!)

- **`WEB_ALLOWLIST`**: Restrict web downloads to trusted domains
  - **Example:** `"github.com,httpbin.org,trusted-site.com"`
  - **Default:** All domains allowed (UNSAFE!)

- **`PROC_ALLOWLIST`**: Restrict which processes can be executed
  - **Example:** `"notepad,chrome,code,python"`
  - **Default:** All processes allowed (UNSAFE!)

- **`ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS`**: Enable dangerous command detection
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"true"` (Good!)

- **`RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS`**: Limit file operations to safe actions
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"false"` (UNSAFE!)

- **`BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS`**: Block potentially harmful system commands
  - **Values:** `"true"` (SAFE) or `"false"` (UNSAFE)
  - **Default:** `"false"` (UNSAFE!)

**üö® Why Guardrails Are Off By Default:**

1. **Maximum Flexibility:** Some users need unrestricted access for advanced automation
2. **Testing & Development:** Developers need full system access for debugging
3. **Trusted Environments:** Some users operate in controlled, trusted environments
4. **Legacy Compatibility:** Ensures existing workflows continue to function

**üîê Production Security Checklist:**

Before using in production, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **Restricted root paths** (`ALLOWED_ROOT`)
- ‚úÖ **Limited web access** (`WEB_ALLOWLIST`)
- ‚úÖ **Process restrictions** (`PROC_ALLOWLIST`)
- ‚úÖ **Security checks enabled** (`ENABLE_SECURITY_CHECKS="true"`)
- ‚úÖ **File operation restrictions** (`RESTRICT_FILE_OPERATIONS="true"`)
- ‚úÖ **Dangerous command blocking** (`BLOCK_DANGEROUS_COMMANDS="true"`)

**üí° Pro Tip:** Start with restrictive settings and gradually loosen them as needed. It's easier to grant access than to recover from a security incident!

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** This MCP has extensive system access. Use responsibly and only on systems you own.

**Comedic Tip:** Start with "Hello, world" not "Delete everything."
