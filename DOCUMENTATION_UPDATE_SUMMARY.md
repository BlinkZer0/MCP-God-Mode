# Documentation Update Summary (sync)

- Modular server unique endpoints: 120
- Server‑refactored unique endpoints: 125
- Exported register functions: 114
- Wiki pages maintained: 123 (aliases consolidated)

Changed
- Added docs: advanced_analytics_engine, advanced_security_assessment, cross_platform_system_manager, enhanced_legal_compliance, enterprise_integration_hub, legal_compliance_manager
- Removed stale docs: ai_site_interaction, captcha_analysis, captcha_bypass, captcha_detection, captcha_solving, DOCUMENTATION_STATUS, universal_browser_operator, wifi_security

Notes
- Counts are derived from static analysis of `dev/src/tools/**` plus the 5 enhanced endpoints in `server-refactored`.
- Some exported functions register multiple endpoints (e.g., web search variants), which is why runtime endpoint counts exceed exported function count.
- A few endpoints are aliases (e.g., a universal operator maps to Browser Control), so documentation consolidates to a single page per capability.

Humor
- If the AI asks for a cape, it’s probably about to escalate privileges. Keep your coffee patched and your routers friendly.
