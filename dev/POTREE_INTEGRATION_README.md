# Potree Integration for RF_sense Tools

## Overview

The RF_sense tools have been successfully updated to use **Potree**, a prominent open-source WebGL-based point cloud viewer designed for handling large datasets within a web browser. This integration provides enhanced visualization capabilities, better performance for large point clouds, and advanced interaction features.

## Acknowledgments

**Special thanks to the Potree project team** for creating this excellent open-source WebGL-based point cloud viewer. We were too lazy to build a point cloud viewer from scratch, so we integrated their fantastic work instead. Potree has made it possible for us to provide professional-grade point cloud visualization capabilities in our RF_sense tools.

Thank you, Potree team, for your excellent work! üôè

## What is Potree?

Potree is a WebGL-based point cloud renderer for large point clouds. It allows users to visualize and interact with point clouds directly through HTML, providing:

- **High Performance**: Optimized for large datasets with millions of points
- **Advanced Visualization**: Multiple rendering modes, color mapping, and measurement tools
- **Web-based**: Runs entirely in the browser without plugins
- **Interactive**: Pan, zoom, rotate, and measure within the point cloud
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile devices

## Cross-Platform Support

The Potree integration has been enhanced with comprehensive cross-platform support for all major platforms:

### Desktop Platforms
- **Windows**: Full desktop support with Windows-specific optimizations, Segoe UI fonts, and Windows-style controls
- **Linux**: Complete compatibility with Linux distributions, Ubuntu/Cantarell fonts, and Linux-specific styling
- **macOS**: Native macOS support with SF Pro Display fonts, macOS-style controls, and platform-specific optimizations

### Mobile Platforms
- **iOS**: Mobile-optimized interface with touch controls, iOS-specific viewport handling, orientation change support, and 44px minimum touch targets
- **Android**: Android WebView compatibility with performance optimizations, hardware acceleration, and Android-specific styling

### Platform Detection & Optimization
The viewer automatically detects the platform and applies appropriate optimizations:

- **Performance Tiers**: Different point budgets and rendering settings based on device capabilities
- **Touch Support**: Automatic touch device detection with appropriate UI scaling
- **WebGL Support**: Graceful fallback for devices without WebGL support
- **High DPI**: Optimized rendering for high-resolution displays
- **Dark Mode**: Platform-specific dark mode support

### Performance Configuration
- **Mobile**: 100K points max, medium quality, conservative settings
- **Desktop**: 2M points max, high quality, full features enabled
- **Fallback**: 500K points max, medium quality for unknown platforms

## Integration Features

### üéØ Enhanced Point Cloud Visualization
- **Potree Viewer**: New HTML-based viewer using Potree library
- **Legacy Support**: Original Three.js viewer remains available as fallback
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Support for intensity, classification, velocity, and SNR data
- **Multiple Color Modes**: Intensity, height, classification, and source-based coloring

### üîß RF_sense Tool Integration
All RF_sense tools now export data in Potree-compatible format:

- **RF_sense mmWave**: Enhanced point cloud export with velocity and SNR data
- **RF_sense WiFi Lab**: CSI-based point cloud generation with classification
- **RF_sense Simulation**: Synthetic data generation with temporal mapping

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- **AI-Safe Scan Mode**: Suspends AI and blocks network egress
- **Local-Only Operations**: Data never leaves the device in scan mode
- **Security Sessions**: Tracked and audited data access
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic data filtering for AI-safe operations

const result = await server.callTool("rf_sense_mmwave", {
  action: "capture_start",
  durationSec: 30,
  captureMode: "point_cloud",
  enableScanMode: true
});

// Process the data
const processed = await server.callTool("rf_sense_mmwave", {
  action: "process",
  sessionId: result.sessionId,
  pipeline: "point_cloud"
});

// Open Potree viewer
const viewer = await server.callTool("rf_sense_mmwave", {
  action: "open_viewer",
  sessionId: result.sessionId
});
```

### 2. Using RF_sense WiFi Lab Tool

```javascript
// Start WiFi lab capture
const result = await server.callTool("rf_sense_wifi_lab", {
  action: "capture_start",

## Security Considerations

### AI-Safe Scan Mode
- **Network Blocking**: All external network requests are blocked
- **AI Suspension**: AI processing is suspended during scan mode
- **Local Storage**: Data is stored locally in browser IndexedDB
- **Export Control**: Manual export required to share data

### Data Sanitization
- **Automatic Filtering**: Sensitive data is automatically filtered
- **Response Limiting**: API responses are limited in scan mode
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Viewer Not Loading**
   - Check if the MCP server is running
   - Verify the port (default: 3000)
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Point Cloud Not Rendering**
   - Verify data format is correct
   - Check if points have valid coordinates
   - Ensure sufficient memory for large datasets

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Reduce point count using voxel downsampling
   - Lower quality settings in viewer
   - Close other browser tabs
