# üõ∏ Unified Drone Management Tool - MCP God Mode v1.9

**NEW in v1.9**: All drone functionality has been consolidated into a single unified tool that combines defense, offense, mobile optimization, and natural language processing capabilities with intelligent operation routing.

## üöÄ Overview

The Unified Drone Management Tool provides comprehensive automated threat response capabilities through a single interface that intelligently routes operations based on platform, context, and user intent. This tool combines all previously separate drone functionalities into one powerful, cohesive system.

### Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: Single tool for all drone operations (defense, offense, mobile, natural language)
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically detects platform and optimizes operations accordingly
- **Defensive Operations**: Scan surroundings, deploy shields, evade threats
- **Offensive Operations**: Jam signals, deploy decoys, execute counter-strikes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Battery-efficient, network-aware operations for mobile platforms
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand commands like "scan for threats" or "jam the signals"
- **Safety Controls**: Risk acknowledgment, double confirmation, compliance modes
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive operation logging for compliance
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS with platform-specific optimizations
- **Flipper Zero Integration**: Real hardware control when enabled

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (for refactored build)
- MCP God Mode platform installed

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp drone.env.example .env
   ```

2. Configure your settings in `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Enable drone management
   MCPGM_DRONE_ENABLED=true
   
   # Require confirmation for operations
   MCPGM_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true
   
   # Enable audit logging
   MCPGM_AUDIT_ENABLED=true
   
   # Compliance modes (disable offensive operations)
   MCPGM_MODE_HIPAA=false

   ```

2. Test the unified tool:
   ```bash
   node dist/server-refactored.js
   ```

## üõ∏ Unified Drone Tool

### Tool Registration

The unified drone tool is registered as `drone_unified` and provides all drone functionality through a single interface.

### Operation Modes

The tool supports four operation modes that are automatically selected based on context:

1. **Defense Mode** (`defense`): Defensive operations for threat protection
2. **Offense Mode** (`offense`): Offensive operations for counter-strikes
3. **Mobile Mode** (`mobile`): Mobile-optimized operations for Android/iOS
4. **Natural Language Mode** (`natural_language`): Intelligent command processing

### Available Actions

#### Defense Actions
- `scan_surroundings`: Network scanning and threat detection
- `deploy_shield`: Firewall hardening and protection deployment
- `evade_threat`: Traffic rerouting and threat avoidance

#### Offense Actions
- `jam_signals`: Signal jamming and disruption
- `deploy_decoy`: Honeypot and decoy deployment
- `counter_strike`: Reconnaissance and counter-attack operations

### Parameters

- `mode`: Operation mode (auto-detected from context)
- `action`: Specific drone action to perform
- `target`: Target network, system, or IP address
- `parameters`: Operation-specific parameters including:
  - `threatType`: Type of threat (ddos, intrusion, probe, etc.)
  - `intensity`: Operation intensity (low, medium, high)
  - `enableBatteryOptimization`: Enable battery optimization (mobile)
  - `enableNetworkOptimization`: Enable network optimization (mobile)
  - `enableBackgroundMode`: Enable background mode (mobile)
- `riskAcknowledged`: Required for offensive operations
- `threatLevel`: Threat level (1-10, affects confirmation requirements)
- `autoConfirm`: Skip confirmation prompts
- `naturalLanguageCommand`: Natural language command processing

## üß† Natural Language Processing

The unified tool includes advanced natural language processing capabilities:

### Example Commands

- "Scan for threats on the network"
- "Deploy protection against DDoS attacks"
- "Jam the signals from the attacker"
- "Evade the threat by rerouting traffic"
- "Deploy a decoy to mislead the attacker"
- "Counter-strike against the source IP"

### Supported Patterns

The tool recognizes various command patterns:
- **Scan actions**: scan, search, detect, find, discover, investigate
- **Shield actions**: shield, protect, defend, block, secure, guard
- **Evade actions**: evade, avoid, escape, retreat, hide, dodge
- **Jam actions**: jam, disrupt, block, interfere, scramble
- **Decoy actions**: decoy, fake, bait, trap, lure, distract
- **Strike actions**: strike, attack, retaliate, counter, hit, engage

## üì± Mobile Optimization

When running on mobile platforms (Android/iOS), the tool automatically:

- Optimizes battery usage
- Reduces network data consumption
- Uses touch-friendly interfaces
- Implements background mode support
- Provides platform-specific optimizations

### Mobile Performance Metrics

The tool tracks and reports:
- Battery usage per operation
- Data consumption
- Operation duration
- Platform limitations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Legal Compliance

### Safety Controls

- **Risk Acknowledgment**: Required for all offensive operations
- **Double Confirmation**: Required for high-threat operations (threat level > 7)
- **Compliance Modes**: HIPAA/GDPR modes disable offensive operations
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for compliance

### Legal Warnings

All offensive operations include legal warnings:
- Signal jamming may violate telecommunications regulations
- Counter-strikes may violate computer crime laws
- Decoy deployment may be considered deceptive practices

## üîß Usage Examples

### Basic Defense Operation

```javascript
// Scan for threats
{
  "mode": "defense",

```javascript
// Jam signals with risk acknowledgment
{
  "mode": "offense",
  "action": "jam_signals",
  "target": "192.168.1.100",
  "parameters": {
    "intensity": "medium"
  },
