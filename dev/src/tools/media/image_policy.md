# Image Editor Policy

## Overview
The Image Editor is a comprehensive cross-platform image processing tool that provides advanced editing capabilities while maintaining user privacy and data security.

## Core Principles

### 1. User Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All image processing is performed locally on the user's device
- **No Cloud Upload**: Images are never automatically uploaded to external services
- **Temporary Storage**: Working files are stored in temporary directories and cleaned up automatically
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their image data and processing operations

### 2. Processing Guidelines
- **User-Supplied Content Only**: Only process images explicitly provided by the user
- **Non-Destructive Editing**: Original images are preserved; edits are applied during export
- **Session Management**: Each editing session is isolated and tracked independently
- **Format Support**: Support for all major image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, SVG, PDF)

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Universal Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- **Web Interface**: PWA-enabled web interface for cross-platform access
- **Native Integration**: Desktop and mobile app wrappers for enhanced functionality
- **Consistent Experience**: Uniform interface and capabilities across all platforms

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Layer-Based Editing**: Non-destructive layer system for complex edits
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple images or operations
- **Collage Creation**: Combine multiple images into collages
- **Advanced Filters**: Professional-grade image filters and effects
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintain image metadata when possible

## Usage Guidelines

### Allowed Operations
- ✅ Resize, crop, rotate, and flip images
- ✅ Apply filters (blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, etc.)
- ✅ Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue
- ✅ Add borders, vignettes, and watermarks
- ✅ Create collages from multiple images
- ✅ Batch process multiple images
- ✅ Convert between image formats
- ✅ Extract and preserve metadata

### Prohibited Operations
- ❌ Processing images without user consent
- ❌ Automatic image collection or scraping
- ❌ Uploading images to external services without permission
- ❌ Processing copyrighted material without proper authorization
- ❌ Creating deepfakes or misleading image manipulations
- ❌ Processing images containing personal information without consent

### Data Handling
- **Input Validation**: All input parameters are validated using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and memory
- **Session Isolation**: Each editing session is completely isolated
- **Audit Trail**: Optional logging of operations for debugging purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Sharp**: High-performance image processing library
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and parsing
- **Node.js**: Cross-platform JavaScript runtime
- **React**: Modern web interface framework
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities

### Security Measures
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents access to files outside allowed directories
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large images
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of processing errors
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on image size and processing time

### Performance Considerations
- **Streaming Processing**: Large images are processed in streams when possible
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of processed results
- **Parallel Processing**: Batch operations can be parallelized
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory usage for multiple sessions
- **Format Optimization**: Automatic format selection for optimal performance

## Compliance and Legal

### Copyright and Licensing
- Users are responsible for ensuring they have rights to process images
- The tool does not automatically check for copyright or licensing
- Users must comply with applicable copyright laws and regulations
- Commercial use of processed images requires proper licensing

### Privacy Regulations
- Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- No personal data is collected or stored without explicit consent
- Users can request deletion of temporary files at any time
- All processing is performed locally without external data transmission

### Export and Distribution
- Users are responsible for the content they create and distribute
- The tool provides technical capabilities but does not endorse specific uses
- Users must comply with platform-specific content policies
- Commercial distribution may require additional licensing considerations

## Support and Maintenance

### Documentation
- Comprehensive API documentation for all operations
