# Multimedia Tool Policy

## Overview
The Multimedia Tool is a unified cross-platform multimedia editing suite that combines audio, image, and video processing capabilities into a single, powerful tool. It provides comprehensive editing operations while maintaining user privacy and data security.

## Core Principles

### 1. Unified Media Processing
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles audio (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG), image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, TIFF, BMP, SVG), and video (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM, FLV) formats
- **Cross-Media Operations**: Supports operations that work across different media types
- **Session Management**: Unified session system for all media types
- **Project Organization**: Group related media sessions into projects

### 2. User Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All multimedia processing is performed locally on the user's device
- **No Cloud Upload**: Media files are never automatically uploaded to external services
- **Temporary Storage**: Working files are stored in temporary directories and cleaned up automatically
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their media data and processing operations

### 3. Processing Guidelines
- **User-Supplied Content Only**: Only process media files explicitly provided by the user
- **Non-Destructive Editing**: Original media files are preserved; edits are applied during export
- **Session Management**: Each editing session is isolated and tracked independently
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple files or operations

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Universal Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- **Web Interface**: PWA-enabled web interface for cross-platform access
- **Native Integration**: Desktop and mobile app wrappers for enhanced functionality
- **Consistent Experience**: Uniform interface and capabilities across all platforms

## Supported Operations

### Audio Operations
- **Basic Editing**: Trim, normalize, fade in/out, gain adjustment, reverse
- **Advanced Processing**: Time stretch, pitch shift, audio effects
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between all supported audio formats
- **Quality Control**: Configurable bitrate, sample rate, and compression settings

### Image Operations
- **Basic Editing**: Resize, crop, rotate, flip, filter application
- **Advanced Effects**: Blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, vignette, border
- **Color Adjustments**: Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma correction
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between all supported image formats

### Video Operations
- **Basic Editing**: Cut, merge, resize, format conversion
- **Audio Integration**: Add/remove audio tracks, audio synchronization
- **Subtitle Support**: Add/remove subtitles, timing adjustment
- **Effects Application**: Apply video effects and filters

### Universal Operations
- **Composite**: Layer multiple media elements
- **Watermark**: Add text or image watermarks
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files or operations efficiently
- **Project Management**: Organize related media sessions

## Usage Guidelines

### Allowed Operations
- ✅ Process user-supplied media files
- ✅ Apply standard editing operations (trim, resize, filter, etc.)
- ✅ Convert between supported formats
- ✅ Create composite media from multiple sources
- ✅ Batch process multiple files
- ✅ Organize media into projects
- ✅ Export processed media in various formats

### Prohibited Operations
- ❌ Processing media without user consent
- ❌ Automatic media collection or scraping
- ❌ Uploading media to external services without permission
- ❌ Processing copyrighted material without proper authorization
- ❌ Creating deepfakes or misleading media manipulations
- ❌ Processing media containing personal information without consent

### Data Handling
- **Input Validation**: All input parameters are validated using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and memory
- **Session Isolation**: Each editing session is completely isolated
- **Audit Trail**: Optional logging of operations for debugging purposes

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- **Sharp**: High-performance image processing library
- **FFmpeg**: Comprehensive audio and video processing
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and parsing
- **Node.js**: Cross-platform JavaScript runtime
- **React**: Modern web interface framework
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities

### Security Measures
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents access to files outside allowed directories
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for large media files
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of processing errors
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits on file size and processing time

### Performance Considerations
- **Streaming Processing**: Large media files are processed in streams when possible
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of processed results
- **Parallel Processing**: Batch operations can be parallelized
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory usage for multiple sessions
- **Format Optimization**: Automatic format selection for optimal performance

## Session and Project Management

### Session System
- **Unique Identifiers**: Each session has a unique ID for tracking
- **Metadata Storage**: Comprehensive metadata for each media file
- **Layer System**: Non-destructive editing with layer support
- **History Tracking**: Track all operations applied to media
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files are cleaned up when sessions are closed

### Project Organization
- **Project Creation**: Group related media sessions into projects
- **Type Classification**: Projects can be audio, image, video, or mixed
- **Session Association**: Link multiple sessions to a single project
- **Project Metadata**: Track project-level information and settings

### Batch Processing
- **Multiple Sessions**: Process multiple sessions simultaneously
- **Operation Queuing**: Queue multiple operations for efficient processing
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor batch processing progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of individual operation failures

## Compliance and Legal

### Copyright and Licensing
- Users are responsible for ensuring they have rights to process media files
- The tool does not automatically check for copyright or licensing
- Users must comply with applicable copyright laws and regulations
- Commercial use of processed media requires proper licensing
